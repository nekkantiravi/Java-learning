    //Enumerations serve the purpose of representing a group of named constants in

	// In Java, we can also add variables, methods and constructors to it. The main
	// objective of enum is to define our own data types(Enumerated Data Types).

	// Enum declaration can be done outside a Class or inside a Class but not inside a Method.
	// A simple enum example where enum is declared
